This module focuses on focusing on a target distance between the ultrasonic sensor
and an object (such as a hand or paper). The defuser must place their object in the
specified range of distances (given by the expert) and press a confirm button.
As each range is confirmed, the next range becomes a smaller range within the previous
one as if the distance were "focusing in on a target spot".
